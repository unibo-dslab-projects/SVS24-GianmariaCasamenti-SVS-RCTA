My project about Smart Vehicular System exam is a RCTA system that represents
an implementation of a critical ADAS designed to enhance vehicle safety during reversing maneuvers. 
This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision, sensor fusion, and real-time decision-making within
the CARLA autonomous driving simulator.
